## Overview
spant provides a full suite of tools to build automated analysis pipelines for
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) data. The following features and
algorithms are included:

* Advanced fully-automated metabolite fitting algorithm - ABfit https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28385.
* Robust retrospective frequency and phase correction - RATS https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27605.
* Flexible data types to support single voxel, dynamic and spectroscopic imaging data types.
* Raw data import from individual coils and dynamic measurements, eg support for importing individual FIDs from Siemens TWIX formatted data.
* Publication quality plotting.
* Extensive set of pre-processing steps (phasing, coil-combination, zero-filling, HSVD filtering...)
* Quantum mechanical based simulation for experimental design and basis-set generation.
* Set of metabolite, macromolecule and lipid parameters for typical brain analyses.
* Voxel registration to anatomical images for partial volume concentration corrections.

## Installation
Download and install the latest version of R (https://cloud.r-project.org/), or with your package manager if using a recent Linux distribution, eg `sudo apt install r-base`.

It is also strongly recommended to install RStudio Desktop (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download) to provide a modern environment for interactive data analysis.

Once R and RStudio have been installed, open the RStudio application and type the following in the Console (lower left panel) to install the latest stable version of spant:
```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("spant", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or the the development version from GitHub (requires the `devtools` package):
```{r github, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martin3141/spant", ref = "devel")
```

### Ubuntu 20.04 installation
CRAN packages need to be compiled on Linux, and therefore you may need to ensure some additional system libraries are installed. spant may be installed from a clean installation of Ubuntu 20.04 with the following commands pasted into the terminal:

```{ubuntu install, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install -y r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libtiff5-dev
mkdir -p ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6
Rscript -e 'install.packages("spant", dependencies = TRUE)'
```

### Ubuntu 21.10 installation
```{ubuntu 2110 install, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install -y r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libtiff5-dev
mkdir -p ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0
Rscript -e 'install.packages("spant", dependencies = TRUE)'
```

## Documentation
Quick introduction to the basic analysis workflow : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/articles/spant-intro.html

Short tutorials : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/articles/

Function reference : https://martin3141.github.io/spant/reference/

Once the spant library has been loaded with `library(spant)`, type `?spant` on the console for instructions on how to access the offline documentation. Note that offline help on the available functions can be quickly shown in RStudio using `?function_name`, eg `?read_mrs`.
